# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

### Entities and Attributes


| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK)                         | Notes |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------|                         
| Member |MemberID (PK), Name,MembershipType, StartDate| Stores gym members’ details         |
| Program     | ProgramID (PK), ProgramName, Type                   | Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training, etc.      |
| Trainer        |   TrainerID (PK), Name, Specialization                 |Each trainer may handle multiple programs       |
|  Session      |    SessionID (PK), Date, Time, TrainerID (FK), ProgramID (FK)                |   Personal training or group sessions    |
|Payment        |  PaymentID (PK), MemberID (FK), Amount, PaymentDate, Type                  |     Tracks membership & session payments  |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|  Registers (Member–Program)            | M:N           |  Partial (not all members join all programs)             | A member may join many programs      |
